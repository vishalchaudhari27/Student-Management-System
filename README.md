## 📌 Introduction

This is a **Student Management System** project built using **Java, Hibernate, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, MySQL, and Thymeleaf**. It is a simple **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** application that manages student records in a clean and user-friendly way.

## 🚀 Features

* **Add Student** → Button on the top of the list opens a form to create a new student. On submit, the student is added to the list.
* **Update Student** → Each student row has an **Update** button. Clicking it opens a form with pre-filled student details. After editing and submitting, the updated information is saved and the user is redirected to the student list.
* **Delete Student** → Each student row also has a **Delete** button. Clicking it deletes the student instantly from the database without opening any form.
* **Clean UI** using **Bootstrap** and **Thymeleaf templates**.
